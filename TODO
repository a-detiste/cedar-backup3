update release procedure to match Mercurial and BitBucket
add trove categories in setup.py
review all documentation for completeness
review all URLs in source code and documentation to make sure they still exist
run pylint on codebase and get things clean
get things running in Cloudbees Jenkins (including coverage, pylint reports, etc. if possible)
figure out why mkisofs sometimes fails when running full tests on dev system (can't reproduce easily)
start looking at code coverage to see if there are other tests I need to write
fix unit tests that are failing on Cloudbees Jenkins (all look like encoding-type issues)
